# OCV and Entropy estimation toolbox
The toolbox and tutorial was created by Svenas Burba mail:(burba.svenas@uia.no)

This is a toolbox that is based in MatLab to estimate open circuit voltage and entropy coefficients from experiment charge/discharge data of full and half-cell formats. The toolbox is presented in a tutorial form with step by step guide on requirements and execution process. The repository contains all the neccessary files to complete the tutorial and toolbox it self to use for your own needs. Additionally, repository contains the data that was used to estimate entropy coefficients and open circuit voltages for half-cells used in the work: **Data Driven Entropy Coefficient Estimation for Large-Format Lithium-Ion Batteries**  

## Toolbox tutorial on github clone

You can clone and work with github repository in MatLab online or your local MatLab application following these steps:

1. Open Local MatLab or Matlab online
2. Navigate to "Home" menu
3. Hover over "New" dropdown menu
4. Click on "Git Clone"
5. In the dialog box "URL:" field past in the repository clone link and click "clone"
6. In the cloned repository open "Entropy_estimation_tutorial.mlx" and follow execution instructions 


## Toolbox tutorial in local drive

The toolbox repository can be downloaded and used locally on the system following these steps:
1. Extract the "Entropy-estimation-toolbox.zip" file at your desired location
2. Locate the "Entropy_estimation_tutorial.mlx" and open it in your MatLab application
3. Make sure that "Entropy-estimation-toolbox" is your working folder, **if not**, locate "browse for folder" and locate "Entropy-estimation-toolbox" folder in windows file browser
4. Then the "Entropy_estimation_tutorial.mlx" should work without errors following instructions
