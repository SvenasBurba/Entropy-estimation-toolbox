# OCV and Entropy estimation toolbox
The toolbox and tutorial was created by Svenas Burba mail:(burba.svenas@uia.no)

This is a estimation toolbox that is based in MatLab to estimate open circuit voltage and entropy coefficients from experiment charge/discharge data of full and half-cell. The toolbox is presented as a tutorial form with step by step guide on requirements and execution process. The repository contains all the neccessary files to complete the tutorial and toolbox it self to use for your own needs.
